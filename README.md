# GeniusReads: AI-Powered PDF Reader for Deep Learning

GeniusReads is a local-first, AI-powered PDF reader for macOS designed to help you deeply understand technical documents. It transforms your reading into an interactive experience by allowing you to have AI-driven conversations about the content and automatically builds a personal, searchable knowledge base from your discussions.

## Core Features

- 📖 **PDF Reading:** A clean, intuitive interface for reading PDF documents.
- ✨ **AI-Powered Chat:** Highlight any text in a PDF, press `CMD+K`, and instantly start a conversation with an AI to get explanations, ask questions, or explore concepts in more depth.
- 🧠 **Automated Knowledge Corpus:** When you're done with a conversation, GeniusReads analyzes it, automatically extracts key concepts, and adds them to your personal knowledge base.
- 🔗 **Connected Knowledge:** Concepts are linked back to their original source in your documents, creating a rich, interconnected web of your learnings across your entire library.
- 🗂️ **Persistent & Local:** All your documents, chats, and knowledge are stored locally on your machine in a robust PostgreSQL database.

## How It Works

The GeniusReads workflow is designed to be seamless and intuitive, moving from reading to learning to reviewing without friction.

1.  **Library Tab:** Open and read your PDF documents.
2.  **Chat Tab:** Highlight confusing text and press `CMD+K` to start a chat. The highlighted text provides the initial context for the AI. You can add more context from any document to the same chat.
3.  **Knowledge Tab:** After a chat, click "Analyze". GeniusReads processes the conversation in the background, identifies key concepts, and adds them to your knowledge base, which you can browse and search in the Knowledge tab.

## Technical Architecture

GeniusReads is built with a modern, database-first architecture to ensure all state is persistent and resilient.

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
- **Desktop Framework:** [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend).
- **Backend Logic:** Rust, with Python integration via [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) for AI processing.
- **AI Orchestration:** [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph) for the concept extraction pipeline.
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension for vector similarity search.
- **State Management:** A "database-first" approach where all application state (UI state, reading position, active chats) is stored in PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Cargo
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) running locally.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/genius-reads.git
    cd genius-reads
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup the database:**
    - Create a PostgreSQL database named `genius_reads`.
    - Run the migrations to set up the schema:
      ```bash
      # You'll need a tool like `sqlx-cli` or a GUI client to run the migrations
      # Point it to the `migrations` directory.
      ```

4.  **Set up Python environment:**
    - It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    cd src-tauri/python
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```
