#### Native macOS UI Patterns ✅
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Clean, functional sidebar with sections and stats
- **Toolbar Design**: Context-appropriate toolbars for each view mode
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper spacing, typography, and component organization
- **Interaction Design**: Single-click document opening with immediate reader access

#### Eliminated Web-App Patterns ✅
- **Removed Routing**: No more React Router or multi-page navigation
- **Removed Marketing**: No hero sections, "Welcome back!" copy, or web-style headers
- **Simplified Navigation**: Direct functional access without web-style navigation bars
- **Enhanced Focus**: Tool-like interface focused on document reading and knowledge management

### Technical Architecture Enhanced ✅
1. **Simplified Component Structure**: Removed routing complexity and unused components
2. **Integrated Functionality**: PDF viewer embedded within main dashboard interface
3. **State Management**: Unified state handling within single application window
4. **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed React Router and associated routing dependencies
5. **Performance**: Reduced bundle size and eliminated unnecessary page transitions

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3: Text Selection System) - **READY TO START WITH ENHANCED UI**
**With desktop-native interface complete and PDF system operational:**

1. **Task 3.1**: Text selection overlay system for PDF content
   - Create transparent overlay component for capturing mouse events within integrated reader
   - Implement click-and-drag text highlighting functionality
   - Extract text coordinates from PDF.js selection system

2. **Task 3.2**: Question input interface triggered by text selection
   - Create QuestionInput component that appears on text selection within reader panel
   - Implement text selection state management with custom hooks
   - Add visual feedback for selected text with highlighting styles

3. **Task 3.3**: Text extraction and coordinate storage
   - Store selected text and coordinates in QUESTIONS table
   - Handle edge cases for text selection across page boundaries
   - Add selection clearing when navigating pages or opening new documents

### Short-term (Complete Phase 3)
- Text selection overlay system using PDF.js coordinates within integrated reader
- Click-and-drag highlighting with visual feedback in desktop interface
- Question input interface triggered by text selection with native app styling
- Text extraction and coordinate storage in database

### Medium-term (Phase 4: AI Integration)
