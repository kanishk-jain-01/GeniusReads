## Current Work Focus

**Primary Achievement**: PDF Viewing System Phase 100% Complete ✅ + Critical Bug Fixes Applied
**Phase**: PDF System → Text Selection System (Phase 3)
**Status**: Production-ready PDF viewing functionality with resolved user experience issues

## Recent Activities

### CRITICAL BUG FIXES APPLIED (Latest Session) - PRODUCTION READY ✅
1. **Progress Calculation Issue RESOLVED**: Fixed incorrect progress percentages
   - **Problem**: Dashboard showing 100% progress for documents at 4% actual progress
   - **Root Cause**: Database `total_pages` field showing 1 instead of actual page count
   - **Solution**: Added `update_document_total_pages()` database function and Tauri command
   - **Implementation**: PDF.js now updates database with correct page count on document load
   - **Result**: Real progress calculation (e.g., 17/245 pages = 7% instead of 17/1 = 1700%)

2. **Navigation Issue RESOLVED**: Fixed blank Reader screen when clicking document arrows
   - **Problem**: Arrow buttons from Dashboard leading to empty Reader instead of specific document
   - **Root Cause**: Reader component not handling document ID passed via navigation state
   - **Solution**: Added `useLocation` and `useEffect` to load specific documents
   - **Implementation**: Reader now receives `documentId` and loads the correct document
   - **Result**: Seamless navigation from Dashboard to specific documents

3. **Database Integrity Improvements**: Enhanced data accuracy and consistency
   - Added `updateDocumentTotalPages()` API function for real-time page count updates
   - Updated sqlx query cache with new database operations
   - Manually corrected existing database records with incorrect page counts
   - Implemented automatic page count correction when documents are opened
