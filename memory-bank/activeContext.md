# Active Context: GeniusReads

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Project initialization and task planning
**Phase**: Pre-development setup and architecture planning
**Status**: Task list generation completed, ready to begin implementation

## Recent Activities

### Just Completed
1. **PRD Analysis**: Thoroughly reviewed the comprehensive PRD for GeniusReads
2. **Task List Generation**: Created detailed 54-subtask breakdown across 6 major areas
3. **Memory Bank Setup**: Initializing project documentation structure
4. **Task 1.1 Complete**: Successfully initialized Tauri project with React TypeScript template
5. **Environment Setup**: Rust toolchain installed and configured
6. **Project Structure**: Proper directory structure established with corrected naming

### Current Session Goals
- âœ… Establish memory bank foundation for project tracking
- âœ… Begin task 1.1: Tauri project initialization
- ðŸš§ Ready to proceed with Task 1.2: Configure Cargo.toml dependencies

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Tauri + React**: Confirmed for cross-platform desktop with web technologies
- **Embedded Python**: Using pyo3 for LangGraph integration rather than separate service
- **Local PostgreSQL**: For robust knowledge storage and search capabilities
- **PDF.js**: For reliable cross-platform PDF rendering

### Implementation Strategy
- **Sequential task execution**: One sub-task at a time with user approval
- **Memory bank maintenance**: Regular updates as development progresses
- **Test-driven approach**: Include testing considerations in each component

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Tasks)
1. âœ… **Task 1.1**: Initialize Tauri project with React template
2. **Task 1.2**: Configure Cargo.toml with required Rust dependencies (pyo3, sqlx, serde, tokio)
3. **Task 1.3**: Set up tauri.conf.json for macOS-specific settings and file system permissions

### Short-term (Next 5-10 Tasks)
- Complete Tauri foundation setup (Tasks 1.1-1.8)
- Begin PDF viewing system implementation
- Establish basic UI layout and component structure

### Medium-term Considerations
- Python environment integration complexity
- PostgreSQL local setup requirements
- AI API key configuration and management

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges Ahead
1. **pyo3 Integration**: Embedding Python in Rust may require careful dependency management
2. **PDF.js + Text Selection**: Overlay system for text selection needs precise coordination
3. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI response display requires WebSocket or similar
4. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL installation and migration handling

### User Experience Priorities
- **Performance**: Text selection and AI responses must feel instant
- **Reliability**: PDF loading and display must be rock-solid
- **Simplicity**: Complex technical stack should remain invisible to user

## Context for Next Session

If this session ends, the next session should:
1. Review this memory bank to understand project state
2. Check task list progress in `tasks/tasks-prd-genius-reads.md`
3. Begin with Task 1.1 if not yet started
4. Update memory bank files as development progresses
