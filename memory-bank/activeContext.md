## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2: PDF Viewing System) - **READY TO START**
**With foundation fully validated, we can proceed with confidence:**

1. **Task 2.1**: PDF.js integration and React component setup
   - Install PDF.js dependencies and configure for Tauri environment
   - Create basic PDFViewer component with document rendering
   - Leverage existing type system and component architecture

2. **Task 2.2**: File picker and PDF loading functionality
   - Implement Tauri file dialog for PDF selection
   - Add PDF file reading and metadata extraction
   - Integrate with existing database operations

3. **Task 2.3**: Navigation controls and document state
   - Page navigation, zoom controls, document state management
   - Build on validated IPC communication and type system

### Short-term (Complete Phase 2)
- PDF.js integration with text coordinate extraction
- File system permissions and document loading
- Navigation UI with shadcn/ui components
- Error handling for invalid PDFs and access issues

### Medium-term (Phase 3: Text Selection)
- Text selection overlay system using PDF.js coordinates
- Click-and-drag highlighting with visual feedback
- Question input interface triggered by text selection

## Active Considerations
