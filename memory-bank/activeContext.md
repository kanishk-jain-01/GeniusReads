## Active Decisions

### Three-Tab Chat Architecture ✅ **FINALIZED**

#### User Experience Flow
- **Text Selection**: User highlights text in Library tab → press CMD+K
- **Chat Navigation**: Automatically navigate to Chat tab with highlighted text as context
- **AI Conversation**: ChatGPT-style interface with streaming responses
- **Context Accumulation**: Single active chat accumulates highlighted text from any document
- **Chat Completion**: User chooses Save/Save+Analyze/Delete options
- **Knowledge Building**: Optional LangGraph analysis extracts concepts for Knowledge tab

#### Navigation Shortcuts
- **CMD+K**: Highlight text → Navigate to Chat tab with context
- **CMD+L**: Toggle between Library and Chat tabs (preserves reading position)
- **State Preservation**: Exact reading position and active chat state maintained

#### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Core chat system tables
ACTIVE_CHAT_SESSION (single active chat)
CHAT_SESSIONS (completed conversations)
CHAT_MESSAGES (individual messages)
HIGHLIGHTED_CONTEXTS (text selections with coordinates)
USER_SESSION_STATE (navigation state persistence)

-- Knowledge extraction tables
CONCEPTS (extracted concepts with vector embeddings)
CONCEPT_CHAT_LINKS (relationships with relevance scores)
LANGRAPH_PROCESSING (background processing status)
```
