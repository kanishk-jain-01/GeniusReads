## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Frontend Retrofit Complete - Successfully integrated new UI components and updated dependencies
**Phase**: Core development infrastructure enhanced with modern shadcn/ui components
**Status**: Major frontend overhaul completed, all systems operational

## Recent Activities

### Just Completed (Current Session)
1. **Complete Frontend Retrofit**: ✅ Successfully replaced frontend with modern shadcn/ui components
   - Updated package.json with exact versions from reference project
   - Integrated @hookform/resolvers, date-fns, zod, and other modern dependencies
   - Maintained Tauri-specific dependencies while upgrading UI libraries

2. **Configuration Updates**: ✅ All build configurations updated for compatibility
   - Updated TailwindCSS config with shadcn/ui standard setup including animations
   - Fixed PostCSS configuration from v4 to v3 TailwindCSS setup
   - Updated Vite config to use SWC plugin for better performance
   - Added path mapping (@/*) for cleaner imports

3. **Dependency Management**: ✅ Successfully resolved version conflicts
   - Downgraded from TailwindCSS v4 to v3.4.11 for compatibility
   - Updated all @radix-ui packages to exact reference versions
   - Added missing dependencies: tailwindcss-animate, react-hook-form, zod
   - Maintained all Tauri-specific packages (@tauri-apps/*)

4. **Code Quality Fixes**: ✅ Resolved critical linting and compilation issues
   - Fixed TypeScript interface issues in UI components
   - Removed unused imports across all page components
   - Added proper ESLint disable comments for intentional patterns
   - Maintained build compatibility with zero compilation errors

### Previous Session Accomplishments
- ✅ **Task 1.1**: Tauri project initialization with React TypeScript template
- ✅ **Task 1.2**: Configured Cargo.toml with all required Rust dependencies
- ✅ **Task 1.3**: Set up tauri.conf.json for macOS-specific settings
- ✅ **Task 1.4**: Configured Vite build system with TailwindCSS
- ✅ **Task 1.9**: ESLint and Prettier setup for frontend code quality
- ✅ **Task 1.12**: Rust formatting (rustfmt) and linting (clippy) configuration

## Active Decisions

### Frontend Architecture Confirmed
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Complete component library with all @radix-ui primitives
- **Modern Dependency Stack**: React Hook Form + Zod for forms, React Query for data fetching
- **Enhanced Styling**: TailwindCSS v3 with animations and design system
- **Performance Optimization**: SWC plugin for faster builds and hot reload

### Build System Status
- **Frontend Build**: Vite + SWC + TailwindCSS v3 working perfectly ✅
- **Backend Build**: Rust + Tauri + all dependencies compiling successfully ✅
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload, linting, and formatting all operational ✅
- **Production Builds**: Optimized bundles generating correctly ✅

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Resume Core Development)
1. **Resume Task 1.5**: Basic window layout with main content area and collapsible sidebar
   - Now with complete shadcn/ui component library available
   - Enhanced with modern components like Sidebar, ScrollArea, Card, etc.

2. **Enhanced UI Development**: Leverage new component library
   - Implement responsive layouts with new components
   - Use React Hook Form + Zod for any form validation needs
   - Integrate React Query for future API state management

### Short-term (Next 5-10 Tasks)
- Complete remaining foundation tasks with enhanced UI components
- Begin PDF viewing system implementation with better component structure
- Establish advanced UI layout leveraging full shadcn/ui library

### Medium-term Considerations
- Python environment integration (pyo3 complexity)
- PostgreSQL local setup requirements
- PDF.js integration with enhanced text selection overlay using new components

## Active Considerations

### Technical Achievements Today
1. **Complete Frontend Modernization**: Successfully integrated modern React ecosystem
2. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintained all Tauri functionality while upgrading frontend
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better tooling, faster builds, modern component library
4. **Production Ready**: All builds working, linting clean, TypeScript strict mode enabled

### New Capabilities Unlocked
- **Advanced Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation ready
- **Rich UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui library with 40+ components
- **Better State Management**: React Query integrated for future API calls
- **Enhanced Animations**: TailwindCSS animations and transitions ready
- **Modern Icons**: Lucide React icon library fully integrated

### Development Environment Status
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS v3 + shadcn/ui + SWC ✅
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri + all required crates ✅
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Clippy, Rustfmt all configured ✅
- **Build System**: Development and production builds optimized ✅
- **Component Library**: Complete shadcn/ui with all primitives ✅

## Context for Next Session

The project has undergone a major enhancement:
1. **Frontend Completely Modernized**: New component library and dependencies integrated
2. **Build System Enhanced**: Faster builds with SWC, better tooling
3. **Developer Experience Improved**: Modern React patterns, better imports, enhanced components
4. **Ready for Advanced Development**: Full shadcn/ui library enables sophisticated UI development

**Key Achievement**: Successfully retrofitted entire frontend while maintaining Tauri compatibility and zero breaking changes. The project now has a modern, production-ready frontend foundation with comprehensive component library support.
