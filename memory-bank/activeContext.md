# Active Context: GeniusReads

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Foundation setup and configuration (Task 1.0 series)
**Phase**: Core development infrastructure established
**Status**: 4 of 12 foundation tasks completed, excellent progress on Tauri + React + TailwindCSS setup

## Recent Activities

### Just Completed (Current Session)
1. **Task 1.2 Complete**: ✅ Configured Cargo.toml with all required Rust dependencies
   - Added pyo3 for Python integration, sqlx for PostgreSQL, tokio for async operations
   - Added UUID, chrono, error handling, and logging dependencies
   - All dependencies properly versioned and featured

2. **Task 1.3 Complete**: ✅ Set up tauri.conf.json for macOS-specific settings
   - Configured window properties (1200x800, resizable, centered)
   - Set up Content Security Policy for PDF.js and OpenAI API access
   - Enabled macOS private API for enhanced integration
   - Removed incompatible permissions field for current Tauri version

3. **Task 1.4 Complete**: ✅ Configured Vite build system with TailwindCSS v4
   - Installed TailwindCSS v4, PostCSS, and typography plugin
   - Created comprehensive design system with CSS variables
   - Set up custom component classes for GeniusReads UI elements
   - Verified production and development builds work correctly

4. **Development Tooling Validation**: ✅ All tooling checks passing
   - ESLint: No errors or warnings
   - Prettier: All files properly formatted
   - TypeScript: Clean type checking
   - Rust: Cargo check, clippy, and rustfmt all passing
   - Build system: Frontend and backend compile successfully

### Previous Session Accomplishments
- ✅ **Task 1.1**: Tauri project initialization with React TypeScript template
- ✅ **Task 1.9**: ESLint and Prettier setup for frontend code quality
- ✅ **Task 1.12**: Rust formatting (rustfmt) and linting (clippy) configuration
- ✅ **Memory Bank Setup**: Comprehensive project documentation structure
- ✅ **Task Analysis**: 54-task breakdown reviewed and understood

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Confirmed
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Successfully integrated with PostCSS pipeline
- **Design System**: CSS variables approach for theming and component consistency
- **Tauri Configuration**: macOS-focused with proper security settings for PDF and AI access
- **Dependency Management**: All major Rust crates configured and validated

### Development Workflow Established
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and formatting for both Rust and TypeScript
- **Build Process**: Verified end-to-end build pipeline from development to production
- **Error Handling**: Proactive fixing of configuration compatibility issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Tasks)
1. **Task 1.5**: Install and configure shadcn/ui component library
2. **Task 1.6**: Set up basic window layout with main content area and collapsible sidebar
3. **Task 1.7**: Create initial TypeScript type definitions for app-wide data structures

### Short-term (Next 5-10 Tasks)
- Complete remaining foundation tasks (1.5-1.8)
- Begin PDF viewing system implementation (Tasks 2.0)
- Establish basic UI layout and component structure

### Medium-term Considerations
- Python environment integration (pyo3 complexity)
- PostgreSQL local setup requirements
- PDF.js integration with text selection overlay

## Active Considerations

### Technical Achievements Today
1. **Dependency Resolution**: All Rust and Node.js dependencies working harmoniously
2. **Configuration Compatibility**: Fixed Tauri v2 compatibility issues
3. **Build System Validation**: Confirmed entire toolchain works end-to-end
4. **Code Quality Standards**: Established and validated comprehensive linting/formatting

### Development Environment Status
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS v4 + Vite ✅
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri + all required crates ✅
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Clippy, Rustfmt all configured ✅
- **Build System**: Development and production builds working ✅

### User Experience Priorities
- **Performance**: Foundation optimized for fast development and build times
- **Reliability**: All tooling validated and error-free
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive code quality standards established

## Context for Next Session

The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation:
1. **Foundation Progress**: 4/12 tasks completed in Task 1.0 series
2. **Quality Assurance**: All development tooling validated and working
3. **Next Focus**: shadcn/ui integration (Task 1.5) and UI layout setup
4. **Architecture**: Ready to begin component development and PDF integration

**Key Achievement**: Complete development infrastructure is now established and validated, providing a robust foundation for building the core GeniusReads functionality.
