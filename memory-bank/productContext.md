# Product Context: GeniusReads

## Why This Project Exists

Technical reading presents a fundamental challenge: encountering unfamiliar terms, complex concepts, and dense explanations that create comprehension barriers. Current solutions are fragmented—users must juggle PDF readers, search engines, note-taking apps, and glossaries, breaking their reading flow and hindering deep understanding.

## Problems We Solve

### Primary Problem: Comprehension Friction
- **Technical terminology** creates reading roadblocks
- **Context switching** between apps disrupts focus
- **Knowledge fragmentation** prevents building on previous learning
- **Passive reading** leads to poor retention

### Secondary Problems
- **Isolated learning**: No connection between concepts across documents
- **Forgotten insights**: Notes and definitions get lost over time
- **Inefficient workflow**: Multiple tools create cognitive overhead

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
1. **Seamless Reading**: User opens PDF and reads naturally
2. **Instant Help**: Highlight confusing text → immediate AI explanation
3. **Knowledge Building**: Every explanation automatically saved and organized
4. **Progressive Learning**: Previous concepts inform new explanations

### Key Interactions
- **Text Selection**: Click-and-drag highlighting feels natural and responsive
- **AI Explanations**: Stream in real-time with clear, simple language
- **Knowledge Sidebar**: Collapsible panel shows accumulated learning
- **Note Integration**: Personal notes blend seamlessly with AI explanations

## User Experience Goals

### Immediate Experience
- **Zero setup friction**: Works immediately after installation
- **Intuitive interaction**: No learning curve for basic functionality
- **Fast response**: AI explanations begin streaming within 1-2 seconds

### Long-term Experience
- **Knowledge accumulation**: Users see their understanding grow over time
- **Concept connections**: Related ideas surface automatically
- **Retention improvement**: Review capabilities reinforce learning

## Success Indicators

### Behavioral Success
- Users naturally highlight text when confused
- Knowledge sidebar becomes a regular reference
- Users return to review previous concepts
- Reading sessions become longer and more focused

### Emotional Success
- Reduced frustration when encountering difficult concepts
- Increased confidence in tackling technical material
- Sense of progress and knowledge building
- Joy in making connections between ideas

## Design Philosophy

### Simplicity First
- **Single-purpose focus**: Reading and understanding, nothing more
- **Minimal UI**: PDF content takes center stage
- **Natural interactions**: Leverage familiar patterns (highlighting, sidebar)

### Intelligence That Serves
- **Contextual awareness**: AI understands the document and user's journey
- **Adaptive explanations**: Builds on previously learned concepts
- **Unobtrusive assistance**: Help appears when needed, stays hidden otherwise
