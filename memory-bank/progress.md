# Progress & Status: GeniusReads

This document provides a high-level summary of the project's current state, outlining what is complete, what is in progress, and what is yet to be started.

## ‚úÖ What Works / What is Done

-   **Core Backend & Frontend Foundation:** The Tauri application is functional with a Rust backend, React frontend, and a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
-   **Database Schema:** A comprehensive schema is implemented, including tables for documents, chats, concepts, and support for vector embeddings via `pgvector`.
-   **Core Navigation:** The main three-tab navigation (`Library`, `Chat`, `Knowledge`) is implemented.
-   **Knowledge Base UI:** The "Knowledge" tab is feature-complete. This includes:
    -   A grid view of all extracted concepts.
    -   API-driven, debounced search and filtering.
    -   A concept detail page showing a description, tags, and all source conversations.
    -   Direct navigation from the concept list or detail page to the source chat.
-   **Chat Interface:** A functional chat interface exists for conversations.
-   **PDF Loading & Viewing:** The application can load and display PDFs.

## üöß What is In Progress / Partially Implemented

-   **AI Pipeline (`PyO3`/`LangGraph`):** The bridge is set up, but the pipeline's robustness and error handling are still being refined.
-   **Analysis Workflow:** The end-to-end flow of clicking "Analyze", triggering the pipeline, and seeing the results is functional but needs thorough testing and UI feedback for different states (e.g., `pending`, `failed`).
-   **User Preferences:** The backend can store preferences, but the UI for managing them is not yet built.
-   **State Persistence:** Basic state persistence is in place, but more granular state (like scroll position) may not be fully implemented.

## ‚ùå What is Not Yet Started / Known Issues

-   **Thorough Testing:** No comprehensive, end-to-end testing has been performed across the entire application. This is the highest priority next step.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** While some error handling exists, a full, user-facing error handling strategy (e.g., for AI pipeline failures) is not complete.
-   **UI Polish:** Various parts of the UI could benefit from minor visual polishing and refinement.

## üéØ Immediate Goal

The most critical next step is **thorough end-to-end testing** of the application to ensure stability, identify bugs, and prepare for a release.
