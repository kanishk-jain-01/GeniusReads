# Progress & Status: GeniusReads

This document provides a high-level summary of the project's current state, outlining what is complete, what is in progress, and what is yet to be started.

## ‚úÖ What Works / What is Done

-   **Core Backend Setup:**
    -   Tauri application skeleton is functional.
    -   Rust backend can communicate with the React frontend.
    -   `sqlx` is integrated and can connect to the PostgreSQL database.
-   **Database Schema:**
    -   A comprehensive database schema has been designed and implemented in migration files.
    -   Tables for documents, chats, concepts, and all related entities exist.
    -   The `pgvector` extension is included in the schema, and the `concepts` table has a vector `embedding` column.
-   **Frontend Foundation:**
    -   The project is set up with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
    -   `shadcn/ui` is installed, and the component library is available.
    -   The basic three-tab navigation structure (`Library`, `Chat`, `Knowledge`) is likely in place at a high level.
-   **PRD & Planning:**
    -   A detailed Product Requirements Document (`prd-genius-reads.md`) exists, clarifying the vision and scope.

## üöß What is In Progress / Partially Implemented

-   **PDF Loading & Viewing:** The frontend can likely load a PDF, but the UI for navigating pages and highlighting text is probably still under development.
-   **Tauri Commands:** Some backend commands for database interaction (`documents`, `chat`, etc.) exist in `src-tauri/src/commands/`, but they may not cover all required functionality yet.
-   **AI Pipeline (`PyO3`/`LangGraph`):**
    -   The `PyO3` bridge is set up in `Cargo.toml`, and Python script files exist in `src-tauri/python/`.
    -   However, the actual implementation of the LangGraph concept extraction pipeline is likely a work-in-progress.
-   **Chat Interface:** A basic UI for displaying chat messages may exist, but features like managing the "active" chat, adding multiple contexts, and handling streaming responses are likely incomplete.

## ‚ùå What is Not Yet Started / Known Issues

-   **The "Knowledge" Tab:** The entire UI for browsing and viewing the knowledge base is likely unimplemented.
-   **Analysis Workflow:** The end-to-end flow of clicking "Analyze", triggering the LangGraph pipeline, and seeing the results in the `Knowledge` tab is not yet functional.
-   **Error Handling:** There is likely no robust error handling for database operations or AI pipeline failures.
-   **User Preferences:** The UI and backend logic for managing user settings (like API keys) are missing.
-   **State Persistence:** While the database schema supports it, the application logic to save and restore UI state (like last reading position) across sessions is likely not fully implemented.
-   **Testing:** There are no automated tests for the frontend or backend.

## üéØ Immediate Goal

The most critical next step is to connect the existing pieces into a functional end-to-end loop:
1.  Finalize text highlighting and the `CMD+K` action.
2.  Build out the active chat UI.
3.  Implement the "Analyze" button to trigger the (in-progress) LangGraph pipeline.
4.  Create the initial version of the `Knowledge` tab to display the results.
