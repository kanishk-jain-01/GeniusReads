# Next Steps: GeniusReads

## Foundation Phase: 100% Complete âœ…

**Achievement**: All 9 foundation tasks completed successfully with enterprise-grade infrastructure:
- Complete TypeScript type system (20+ interfaces)
- Verified Tauri-React IPC communication
- PostgreSQL database schema and operations ready
- Modern UI stack with shadcn/ui (40+ components)
- Build system, code quality, and development workflow optimized

## Immediate Priority: Phase 2 - PDF Viewing System

### Task 2.1: PDF.js Integration (Next Session Start)
**Goal**: Set up PDF.js with React component integration
**Actions**:
1. Install PDF.js dependencies (`react-pdf` or `pdfjs-dist`)
2. Configure Vite for PDF.js worker handling
3. Create basic `PDFViewer` component in `src/components/`
4. Test basic PDF rendering with a sample document

**Expected Outcome**: PDF documents can be loaded and displayed in the React app

### Task 2.2: File Picker and PDF Loading
**Goal**: Enable users to select and load PDF files
**Actions**:
1. Add Tauri file dialog command in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
2. Implement PDF file reading and metadata extraction
3. Create file picker UI using shadcn/ui components
4. Connect frontend file selection to backend file handling

**Expected Outcome**: Users can browse and open PDF files from their filesystem

### Task 2.3: Navigation Controls and Document State
**Goal**: Basic PDF navigation functionality
**Actions**:
1. Add page navigation controls (prev/next, page input)
2. Implement zoom controls and document state management
3. Create navigation UI with shadcn/ui components
4. Integrate with existing TypeScript types for document state

**Expected Outcome**: Users can navigate through PDF pages and control zoom

## Development Approach

### Leverage Existing Foundation
- Use established TypeScript types from `src/lib/types.ts`
- Utilize verified IPC patterns from test commands
- Apply shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
- Follow established error handling patterns

### Build Incrementally
1. **Start Simple**: Basic PDF display without advanced features
2. **Add Functionality**: Layer on navigation and controls
3. **Enhance UX**: Polish with animations and responsive design
4. **Prepare for Phase 3**: Ensure coordinate extraction ready for text selection

### Quality Standards
- Maintain 0 warnings/errors in ESLint and Clippy
- Follow established TypeScript patterns
- Use existing error handling infrastructure
- Document new components and functions

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Technical Success
- PDF.js integrated and rendering documents correctly
- File picker working with proper error handling
- Navigation controls functional and responsive
- Document state properly managed and persistent

### User Experience Success
- Intuitive file selection process
- Smooth PDF rendering and navigation
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Responsive design with shadcn/ui components

## Context for Next Session

**Starting Point**: Complete foundation with all infrastructure ready
**Focus**: PDF.js integration as the first major feature implementation
**Resources Available**: 
- Comprehensive type system
- Verified IPC communication
- Complete UI component library
- Operational database for future features

**Key Advantage**: Solid foundation enables rapid feature development without infrastructure concerns. The next session can focus entirely on PDF functionality implementation.

## Estimated Timeline

- **Task 2.1**: 1 session (PDF.js integration)
- **Task 2.2**: 1 session (file picker and loading)
- **Task 2.3**: 1 session (navigation controls)
- **Phase 2 Complete**: 3-4 sessions total

**Next Milestone**: Phase 3 (Text Selection System) - building on PDF coordinate extraction capabilities established in Phase 2.
